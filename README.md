# PortfolioProjects
## 1. Covid Project: 
This project uses SQL and Tableau to perform some EDA on COVID date and see how the world has performed against the virus, including the earliest cases, how fast individual countries responded, and how much of the world has contracted or died of COVID. 

A dashboard I created in Tableau that covers total deaths by continent, percent of the population infected per country, and global numbers can be found here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/vincent.le6052/viz/CovidDashboard_16600739292510/Dashboard1?publish=yes

The dataset used for this project can be found here: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths

## 2. Nashville Housing Project:
While no visualization come as a result of this project, the real purpose of this project was to practice using SQL. Using SQL, I looked through the dataset and cleaning and reformmated the data to be consistent and usable.
